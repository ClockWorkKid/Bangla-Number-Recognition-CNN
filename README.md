# Bangla Number Recognition with CNN on MATLAB

> This project detects Bengali numbers from voice data using a deep convolutional neural network model running on MATLAB.

> The project was ported from a MATLAB example project titled <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ug/deep-learning-speech-recognition.html">"Speech Command Recognition Using MATLAB"</a>

> Face recognition algorithm was used as a subsidiary part of the project following the MATLAB <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/vision.cascadeobjectdetector-system-object.html">Cascade Object Detector</a>
